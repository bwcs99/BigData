marcellus horatio says tis but our fantasy and will not let belief take hold of him touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us therefore i have entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of this night that if again this apparition come he may approve our eyes and speak to it horatio tush tush twill not appear barnardo sit down awhile and let us once again assail your ears that are so fortified against our story what we have two nights seen horatio well sit we down and let us hear barnardo speak of this barnardo last night of all when yond same star that s westward from the pole had made his course t illume that part of heaven where now it burns marcellus and myself the bell then beating one enter ghost marcellus peace break thee off look where it comes again barnardo in the same figure like the king that s dead marcellus to horatio thou art a scholar speak to it horatio barnardo looks he not like the king mark it horatio horatio most like it harrows me with fear and wonder barnardo it would be spoke to marcellus speak to it horatio horatio what art thou that usurp st this time of night together with that fair and warlike form in which the majesty of buried denmark did sometimes march by heaven i charge thee speak marcellus it is offended barnardo see it stalks away horatio stay speak speak i charge thee speak ghost exits marcellus tis gone and will not answer barnardo how now horatio you tremble and look pale is not this something more than fantasy what think you on t horatio before my god i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes marcellus is it not like the king horatio as thou art to thyself such was the very armor he had on when he the ambitious norway combated so frowned he once when in an angry parle he smote the sledded polacks on the ice tis strange marcellus thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch horatio in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of mine opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state marcellus good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint laborer with the day who is t that can inform me horatio that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image even but now appeared to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride dared to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteemed him did slay this fortinbras who by a sealed compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seized of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had returned to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same comart and carriage of the article designed his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there sharked up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach in t which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this posthaste and rummage in the land barnardo i think it be no other but e en so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars horatio a mote it is to trouble the mind s eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptune s empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of feared events as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and countrymen enter ghost but soft behold lo where it comes again i ll cross it though it blast me stay illusion it spreads his arms if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me if thou art privy to thy country s fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it the cock crows stay and speak stop it marcellus marcellus shall i strike it with my partisan horatio do if it will not stand barnardo tis here horatio tis here ghost exits marcellus tis gone we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery barnardo it was about to speak when the cock crew horatio and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air th extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation marcellus it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our savior s birth is celebrated this bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallowed and so gracious is that time horatio so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks o er the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty marcellus let s do t i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most convenient they exit scene 2 flourish enter claudius king of denmark gertrude the queen the council as polonius and his son laertes hamlet with others among them voltemand and cornelius king though yet of hamlet our dear brother s death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen th imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as twere with a defeated joy with an auspicious and a dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barred your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother s death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with this dream of his advantage he hath not failed to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears of this his nephew s purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these dilated articles allow giving them a paper farewell and let your haste commend your duty cornelius voltemand in that and all things will we show our duty king we doubt it nothing heartily farewell voltemand and cornelius exit and now laertes what s the news with you you told us of some suit what is t laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes laertes my dread lord your leave and favor to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon king have you your father s leave what says polonius polonius hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laborsome petition and at last upon his will i sealed my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go king take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son hamlet aside a little more than kin and less than kind king how is it that the clouds still hang on you hamlet not so my lord i am too much in the sun queen good hamlet cast thy nighted color off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark do not forever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou know st tis common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity hamlet ay madam it is common queen if it be why seems it so particular with thee hamlet seems madam nay it is i know not seems tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forced breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected havior of the visage together with all forms moods shapes of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passes show these but the trappings and the suits of woe king tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persever in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschooled for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son queen let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg hamlet i shall in all my best obey you madam king why tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforced accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the king s rouse the heaven shall bruit again respeaking earthly thunder come away flourish all but hamlet exit hamlet o that this too too sullied flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew or that the everlasting had not fixed his canon gainst self slaughter o god god how weary stale flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world fie on t ah fie tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature possess it merely that it should come to this but two months dead nay not so much not two so excellent a king that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me not think on t frailty thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followed my poor father s body like niobe all tears why she even she o god a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mourned longer married with my uncle my father s brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes she married o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets it is not nor it cannot come to good but break my heart for i must hold my tongue enter horatio marcellus and barnardo horatio hail to your lordship hamlet i am glad to see you well horatio or i do forget myself horatio the same my lord and your poor servant ever hamlet sir my good friend i ll change that name with you and what make you from wittenberg horatio marcellus marcellus my good lord hamlet i am very glad to see you to barnardo good even sir but what in faith make you from wittenberg horatio a truant disposition good my lord hamlet i would not hear your enemy say so nor shall you do my ear that violence to make it truster of your own report against yourself i know you are no truant but what is your affair in elsinore we ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart horatio my lord i came to see your father s funeral hamlet i prithee do not mock me fellow student i think it was to see my mother s wedding horatio indeed my lord it followed hard upon hamlet thrift thrift horatio the funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables would i had met my dearest foe in heaven or ever i had seen that day horatio my father methinks i see my father horatio where my lord hamlet in my mind s eye horatio horatio i saw him once he was a goodly king hamlet he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again horatio my lord i think i saw him yesternight hamlet saw who horatio my lord the king your father hamlet the king my father horatio season your admiration for a while with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you hamlet for god s love let me hear horatio two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and barnardo on their watch in the dead waste and middle of the night been thus encountered a figure like your father armed at point exactly cap a pie appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walked by their oppressed and fear surprised eyes within his truncheon s length whilst they distilled almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had delivered both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like hamlet but where was this marcellus my lord upon the platform where we watch hamlet did you not speak to it horatio my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up its head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanished from our sight hamlet tis very strange horatio as i do live my honored lord tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it hamlet indeed sirs but this troubles me hold you the watch tonight all we do my lord hamlet armed say you all armed my lord hamlet from top to toe all my lord from head to foot hamlet then saw you not his face horatio o yes my lord he wore his beaver up hamlet what looked he frowningly horatio a countenance more in sorrow than in anger hamlet pale or red horatio nay very pale hamlet and fixed his eyes upon you horatio most constantly hamlet i would i had been there horatio it would have much amazed you hamlet very like stayed it long horatio while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred barnardo marcellus longer longer horatio not when i saw t hamlet his beard was grizzled no horatio it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silvered hamlet i will watch tonight perchance twill walk again horatio i warrant it will hamlet if it assume my noble father s person i ll speak to it though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace i pray you all if you have hitherto concealed this sight let it be tenable in your silence still and whatsomever else shall hap tonight give it an understanding but no tongue i will requite your loves so fare you well upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve i ll visit you all our duty to your honor hamlet your loves as mine to you farewell all but hamlet exit my father s spirit in arms all is not well i doubt some foul play would the night were come till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise though all the earth o erwhelm them to men s eyes he exits scene 3 enter laertes and ophelia his sister laertes my necessaries are embarked farewell and sister as the winds give benefit and convey is assistant do not sleep but let me hear from you ophelia do you doubt that laertes for hamlet and the trifling of his favor hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more ophelia no more but so laertes think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weighed his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalued persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the safety and the health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscribed unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honor may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmastered importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclosed and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent be wary then best safety lies in fear youth to itself rebels though none else near ophelia i shall the effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart but good my brother do not as some ungracious pastors do show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whiles like a puffed and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede laertes o fear me not enter polonius i stay too long but here my father comes a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave polonius yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stayed for there my blessing with thee and these few precepts in thy memory look thou character give thy thoughts no tongue nor any unproportioned thought his act be thou familiar but by no means vulgar those friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new hatched unfledged courage beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in bear t that th opposed may beware of thee give every man thy ear but few thy voice take each man s censure but reserve thy judgment costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not expressed in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous chief in that neither a borrower nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry this above all to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man farewell my blessing season this in thee laertes most humbly do i take my leave my lord polonius the time invests you go your servants tend laertes farewell ophelia and remember well what i have said to you ophelia tis in my memory locked and you yourself shall keep the key of it laertes farewell laertes exits polonius what is t ophelia he hath said to you ophelia so please you something touching the lord hamlet polonius marry well bethought tis told me he hath very oft of late given private time to you and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous if it be so as so tis put on me and that in way of caution i must tell you you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behooves my daughter and your honor what is between you give me up the truth ophelia he hath my lord of late made many tenders of his affection to me polonius affection puh you speak like a green girl unsifted in such perilous circumstance do you believe his tenders as you call them ophelia i do not know my lord what i should think polonius marry i will teach you think yourself a baby that you have ta en these tenders for true pay which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase running it thus you ll tender me a fool ophelia my lord he hath importuned me with love in honorable fashion polonius ay fashion you may call it go to go to ophelia and hath given countenance to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven polonius ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter giving more light than heat extinct in both even in their promise as it is a making you must not take for fire from this time be something scanter of your maiden presence set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parle for lord hamlet believe so much in him that he is young and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you in few ophelia do not believe his vows for they are brokers not of that dye which their investments show but mere implorators of unholy suits breathing like sanctified and pious bawds the better to beguile this is for all i would not in plain terms from this time forth have you so slander any moment leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet look to t i charge you come your ways ophelia i shall obey my lord they exit scene 4 enter hamlet horatio and marcellus hamlet the air bites shrewdly it is very cold horatio it is a nipping and an eager air hamlet what hour now horatio i think it lacks of twelve marcellus no it is struck horatio indeed i heard it not it then draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk a flourish of trumpets and two pieces goes off what does this mean my lord hamlet the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse keeps wassail and the swagg ring upspring reels and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down the kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge horatio is it a custom hamlet ay marry is t but to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honored in the breach than the observance this heavy headed revel east and west makes us traduced and taxed of other nations they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition and indeed it takes from our achievements though performed at height the pith and marrow of our attribute so oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birth wherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by the o ergrowth of some complexion oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason or by some habit that too much o erleavens the form of plausive manners that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being nature s livery or fortune s star his virtues else be they as pure as grace as infinite as man may undergo shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault the dram of evil doth all the noble substance of a doubt to his own scandal enter ghost horatio look my lord it comes hamlet angels and ministers of grace defend us be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell be thy intents wicked or charitable thou com st in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee i ll call thee hamlet king father royal dane o answer me let me not burst in ignorance but tell why thy canonized bones hearsed in death have burst their cerements why the sepulcher wherein we saw thee quietly interred hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again what may this mean that thou dead corse again in complete steel revisits thus the glimpses of the moon making night hideous and we fools of nature so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls say why is this wherefore what should we do ghost beckons horatio it beckons you to go away with it as if it some impartment did desire to you alone marcellus look with what courteous action it waves you to a more removed ground but do not go with it horatio no by no means hamlet it will not speak then i will follow it horatio do not my lord hamlet why what should be the fear i do not set my life at a pin s fee and for my soul what can it do to that being a thing immortal as itself it waves me forth again i ll follow it horatio what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles o er his base into the sea and there assume some other horrible form which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness think of it the very place puts toys of desperation without more motive into every brain that looks so many fathoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath hamlet it waves me still go on i ll follow thee marcellus you shall not go my lord they hold back hamlet hamlet hold off your hands horatio be ruled you shall not go hamlet my fate cries out and makes each petty arture in this body as hardy as the nemean lion s nerve still am i called unhand me gentlemen by heaven i ll make a ghost of him that lets me i say away go on i ll follow thee ghost and hamlet exit horatio he waxes desperate with imagination marcellus let s follow tis not fit thus to obey him horatio have after to what issue will this come marcellus something is rotten in the state of denmark horatio heaven will direct it marcellus nay let s follow him they exit scene 5 enter ghost and hamlet hamlet whither wilt thou lead me speak i ll go no further ghost mark me hamlet i will ghost my hour is almost come when i to sulf rous and tormenting flames must render up myself hamlet alas poor ghost ghost pity me not but lend thy serious hearing to what i shall unfold hamlet speak i am bound to hear ghost so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear hamlet what ghost i am thy father s spirit doomed for a certain term to walk the night and for the day confined to fast in fires till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purged away but that i am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house i could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres thy knotted and combined locks to part and each particular hair to stand an end like quills upon the fearful porpentine but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood list list o list if thou didst ever thy dear father love hamlet o god ghost revenge his foul and most unnatural murder hamlet murder ghost murder most foul as in the best it is but this most foul strange and unnatural hamlet haste me to know t that i with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love may sweep to my revenge ghost i find thee apt and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed that roots itself in ease on lethe wharf wouldst thou not stir in this now hamlet hear tis given out that sleeping in my orchard a serpent stung me so the whole ear of denmark is by a forged process of my death rankly abused but know thou noble youth the serpent that did sting thy father s life now wears his crown hamlet o my prophetic soul my uncle ghost ay that incestuous that adulterate beast with witchcraft of his wits with traitorous gifts o wicked wit and gifts that have the power so to seduce won to his shameful lust the will of my most seeming virtuous queen o hamlet what a falling off was there from me whose love was of that dignity that it went hand in hand even with the vow i made to her in marriage and to decline upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor to those of mine but virtue as it never will be moved though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven so lust though to a radiant angel linked will sate itself in a celestial bed and prey on garbage but soft methinks i scent the morning air brief let me be sleeping within my orchard my custom always of the afternoon upon my secure hour thy uncle stole with juice of cursed hebona in a vial and in the porches of my ears did pour the leprous distilment whose effect holds such an enmity with blood of man that swift as quicksilver it courses through the natural gates and alleys of the body and with a sudden vigor it doth posset and curd like eager droppings into milk the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine and a most instant tetter barked about most lazar like with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body thus was i sleeping by a brother s hand of life of crown of queen at once dispatched cut off even in the blossoms of my sin unhouseled disappointed unaneled no reck ning made but sent to my account with all my imperfections on my head o horrible o horrible most horrible if thou hast nature in thee bear it not let not the royal bed of denmark be a couch for luxury and damned incest but howsomever thou pursues this act taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive against thy mother aught leave her to heaven and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her fare thee well at once the glowworm shows the matin to be near and gins to pale his uneffectual fire adieu adieu adieu remember me he exits hamlet o all you host of heaven o earth what else and shall i couple hell o fie hold hold my heart and you my sinews grow not instant old but bear me stiffly up remember thee ay thou poor ghost whiles memory holds a seat in this distracted globe remember thee yea from the table of my memory i ll wipe away all trivial fond records all saws of books all forms all pressures past that youth and observation copied there and thy commandment all alone shall live within the book and volume of my brain unmixed with baser matter yes by heaven o most pernicious woman o villain villain smiling damned villain my tables meet it is i set it down that one may smile and smile and be a villain at least i am sure it may be so in denmark he writes so uncle there you are now to my word it is adieu adieu remember me i have sworn t enter horatio and marcellus horatio my lord my lord marcellus lord hamlet horatio heavens secure him hamlet so be it marcellus illo ho

wanton wild and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty reynaldo as gaming my lord polonius ay or drinking fencing swearing quarreling drabbing you may go so far reynaldo my lord that would dishonor him polonius faith no as you may season it in the charge you must not put another scandal on him that he is open to incontinency that s not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind a savageness in unreclaimed blood of general assault reynaldo but my good lord polonius wherefore should you do this reynaldo ay my lord i would know that polonius marry sir here s my drift and i believe it is a fetch of wit you laying these slight sullies on my son as twere a thing a little soiled i th working mark you your party in converse him you would sound having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty be assured he closes with you in this consequence

matter ophelia o my lord my lord i have been so affrighted polonius with what i th name of god ophelia my lord as i was sewing in my closet lord hamlet with his doublet all unbraced no hat upon his head his stockings fouled ungartered and down gyved to his ankle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors he comes before me polonius mad for thy love ophelia my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it polonius what said he ophelia he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus o er his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stayed he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he raised a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turned he seemed to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their helps and to the last bended their light on me polonius come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passions under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late ophelia no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me polonius that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not coted him i feared he did but trifle and meant to wrack thee but beshrew my jealousy by heaven it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love come they exit scene 2 flourish enter king and queen rosencrantz and guildenstern and attendants king welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you

understanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and sith so neighbored to his youth and havior that you vouchsafe your rest here in our

that that do i long to hear polonius give first admittance to th ambassadors my news shall be the fruit to that great feast king thyself do grace to them and bring them in polonius exits he tells me my dear gertrude he hath found the head and source of all your son s distemper queen i doubt it is no other but the main his father s death and our o erhasty marriage king well we shall sift him enter ambassadors voltemand and cornelius with polonius welcome my good friends say voltemand what from our brother norway voltemand most fair return of greetings and desires upon our first he sent out to suppress his nephew s levies which to him appeared to be a preparation gainst the polack but better looked into he truly found it was against your highness whereat grieved that so his sickness age and impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras which he in brief obeys receives rebuke from norway and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give th assay of arms against your majesty whereon old norway overcome with joy gives him three score thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before against the polack with an entreaty herein further shown he gives a paper that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set down king it likes us well and at our more considered time we ll read answer and think upon this business meantime we thank you for your well took labor go to your rest at night we ll feast together most welcome home voltemand and cornelius exit polonius this business is well ended my liege and madam to expostulate what majesty should be what duty is why day is day night night and time is time were nothing but to waste night day and time therefore since brevity is the soul of wit and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes i will be brief your noble son is mad mad call i it for to define true madness what is t but to be nothing else but mad but let that go queen more matter with less art polonius madam i swear i use no art at all that he s mad tis true tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend i have a daughter have while she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this now gather and surmise he reads to the celestial and my soul s idol the most beautified ophelia that s an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is a vile phrase but you shall hear thus he reads in her excellent white bosom these etc queen came this from hamlet to her polonius good madam stay awhile i will be faithful he reads the letter doubt thou the stars are fire doubt that the sun doth move doubt truth to be a liar but never doubt i love o dear ophelia i am ill at these numbers i have not art to reckon my groans but that i love thee best o most best believe it adieu thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him hamlet this in obedience hath my daughter shown me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear king but how hath she received his love polonius what do you think of me king as of a man faithful and honorable polonius i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceived it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had played the desk or table book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or looked upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i prescripts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repelled a short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we mourn for king to queen do you think tis this queen it may be very like polonius hath there been such a time i would fain know that that i have positively said tis so when it proved otherwise king not that i know polonius take this from this if this be otherwise if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the center king how may we try it further polonius you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby queen so he does indeed polonius at such a time i ll loose my daughter to him to the king be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason fall n thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters king we will try it enter hamlet reading on a book queen but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading polonius away i do beseech you both away i ll board him presently o give me leave king and queen exit with attendants how does my good lord hamlet hamlet well god a mercy polonius do you know me my lord hamlet excellent well you are a fishmonger polonius not i my lord hamlet then i would you were so honest a man polonius honest my lord hamlet ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand polonius that s very true my lord hamlet for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion have you a daughter polonius i have my lord hamlet let her not walk i th sun conception is a blessing but as your daughter may conceive friend look to t polonius aside how say you by that still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this i ll speak to him again what do you read my lord hamlet words words words polonius what is the matter my lord hamlet between who polonius i mean the matter that you read my lord hamlet slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here that old men have gray beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for yourself sir shall grow old as i am if like a crab you could go backward polonius aside though this be madness yet there is method in t will you walk out of the air my lord hamlet into my grave polonius indeed that s out of the air aside how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter my lord i will take my leave of you hamlet you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life polonius fare you well my lord hamlet aside these tedious old fools enter guildenstern and rosencrantz polonius you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is rosencrantz to polonius god save you sir polonius exits guildenstern my honored lord rosencrantz my most dear lord hamlet my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do you both rosencrantz as the indifferent children of the earth guildenstern happy in that we are not overhappy on fortune s cap we are not the very button hamlet nor the soles of her shoe rosencrantz neither my lord hamlet then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favors guildenstern faith her privates we hamlet in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet what news rosencrantz none my lord but that the world s grown honest hamlet then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither guildenstern prison my lord hamlet denmark s a prison rosencrantz then is the world one hamlet a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o th worst rosencrantz we think not so my lord hamlet why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison rosencrantz why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind hamlet o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams guildenstern which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream hamlet a dream itself is but a shadow rosencrantz truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow s shadow hamlet then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars shadows shall we to th court for by my fay i cannot reason rosencrantz guildenstern we ll wait upon you hamlet no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore rosencrantz to visit you my lord no other occasion hamlet beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come come deal justly with me come come nay speak guildenstern what should we say my lord hamlet anything but to th purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color i know the good king and queen have sent for you rosencrantz to what end my lord hamlet that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer can charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no rosencrantz to guildenstern what say you hamlet aside nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off guildenstern my lord we were sent for hamlet i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen molt no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor women neither though by your smiling you seem to say so rosencrantz my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts hamlet why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me rosencrantz to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service hamlet he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute on me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o th sear and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for t what players are they rosencrantz even those you were wont to take such delight in the tragedians of the city hamlet how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways rosencrantz i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation hamlet do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed rosencrantz no indeed are they not hamlet how comes it do they grow rusty rosencrantz nay their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an aerie of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for t these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither hamlet what are they children who maintains em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession rosencrantz faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question hamlet is t possible guildenstern o there has been much throwing about of brains hamlet do the boys carry it away rosencrantz ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too hamlet it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out a flourish for the players guildenstern there are the players hamlet gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come then th appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outwards should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived guildenstern in what my dear lord hamlet i am but mad north north west when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw enter polonius polonius well be with you gentlemen hamlet hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts rosencrantz haply he is the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child hamlet i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players mark it you say right sir a monday morning twas then indeed polonius my lord i have news to tell you hamlet my lord i have news to tell you when roscius was an actor in rome polonius the actors are come hither my lord hamlet buzz buzz polonius upon my honor hamlet then came each actor on his ass polonius the best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history pastoral pastoral comical historical pastoral tragical historical tragical comical historical pastoral scene individable or poem unlimited seneca cannot be too heavy nor plautus too light for the law of writ and the liberty these are the only men hamlet o jephthah judge of israel what a treasure hadst thou polonius what a treasure had he my lord hamlet why one fair daughter and no more the which he loved passing well polonius aside still on my daughter hamlet am i not i th right old jephthah polonius if you call me jephthah my lord i have a daughter that i love passing well hamlet nay that follows not polonius what follows then my lord hamlet why as by lot god wot and then you know it came to pass as most like it was the first row of the pious chanson will show you more for look where my abridgment comes enter the players you are welcome masters welcome all i am glad to see thee well welcome good friends o my old friend why thy face is valanced since i saw thee last com st thou to beard me in denmark what my young lady and mistress by r lady your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when i saw you last by the altitude of a chopine pray god your voice like a piece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the ring masters you are all welcome we ll e en to t like french falconers fly at anything we see we ll have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech first player what speech my good lord hamlet i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviary to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affection but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in t i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially when he speaks of priam s slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like th hyrcanian beast tis not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in th ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smeared with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly tricked with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons baked and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damned light to their lord s murder roasted in wrath and fire and thus o ersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you polonius fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion first player anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal matched pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword th unnerved father falls then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seemed i th air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new a work and never did the cyclops hammers fall on mars s armor forged for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword now falls on priam out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven as low as to the fiends polonius this is too long hamlet it shall to the barber s with your beard prithee say on he s for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps say on come to hecuba first player but who ah woe had seen the mobled queen hamlet the mobled queen polonius that s good mobled queen is good first player run barefoot up and down threat ning the flames with bisson rheum a clout upon that head where late the diadem stood and for a robe about her lank and all o erteemed loins a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up who this had seen with tongue in venom steeped gainst fortune s state would treason have pronounced but if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husband s limbs the instant burst of clamor that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods polonius look whe er he has not turned his color and has tears in s eyes prithee no more hamlet tis well i ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live polonius my lord i will use them according to their desert hamlet god s bodykins man much better use every man after his desert and who shall scape whipping use them after your own honor and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in polonius come sirs hamlet follow him friends we ll hear a play tomorrow as polonius and players exit hamlet speaks to the first player dost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of gonzago first player ay my lord hamlet we ll ha t tomorrow night you could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which i would set down and insert in t could you not first player ay my lord hamlet very well follow that lord and look you mock him not first player exits my good friends i ll leave you till night you are welcome to elsinore rosencrantz good my lord hamlet ay so good bye to you rosencrantz and guildenstern exit now i am alone o what a rogue and peasant slave am i is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wanned tears in his eyes distraction in his aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what s hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appall the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddy mettled rascal peak like john a dreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damned defeat was made am i a coward who calls me villain breaks my pate across plucks off my beard and blows it in my face tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i th throat as deep as to the lungs who does me this ha swounds i should take it for it cannot be but i am pigeon livered and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slave s offal bloody bawdy villain remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain o vengeance why what an ass am i this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murdered prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall a cursing like a very drab a stallion fie upon t foh about my brains hum i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaimed their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ i ll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i ll observe his looks i ll tent him to the quick if he do blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be a devil and the devil hath power t assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me i ll have grounds more relative than this the play s the thing wherein i ll catch the conscience of the king he exits act 3 scene 1 enter king queen polonius ophelia rosencrantz guildenstern and lords king and can you by no drift of conference get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy rosencrantz he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak guildenstern nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state queen did he receive you well rosencrantz most like a gentleman guildenstern but with much forcing of his disposition rosencrantz niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply queen did you assay him to any pastime rosencrantz madam it so fell out that certain players we o erraught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are here about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him polonius tis most true and he beseeched me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter king with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclined good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose into these delights rosencrantz we shall my lord rosencrantz and guildenstern and lords exit king sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behaved if t be th affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for queen i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlet s wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again to both your honors ophelia madam i wish it may queen exits polonius ophelia walk you here gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves to ophelia read on this book that show of such an exercise may color your loneliness we are oft to blame in this tis too much proved that with devotion s visage and pious action we do sugar o er the devil himself king aside o tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlot s cheek beautied with plast ring art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burden polonius i hear him coming let s withdraw my lord they withdraw enter hamlet hamlet to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wished to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay there s the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause there s the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time th oppressor s wrong the proud man s contumely the pangs of despised love the law s delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of th unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pitch and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remembered ophelia good my lord how does your honor for this many a day hamlet i humbly thank you well ophelia my lord i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to redeliver i pray you now receive them hamlet no not i i never gave you aught ophelia my honored lord you know right well you did and with them words of so sweet breath composed as made the things more rich their perfume lost take these again for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind there my lord hamlet ha ha are you honest ophelia my lord hamlet are you fair ophelia what means your lordship hamlet that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty ophelia could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty hamlet ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once ophelia indeed my lord you made me believe so hamlet you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not ophelia i was the more deceived hamlet get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offenses at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery where s your father ophelia at home my lord hamlet let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but in s own house farewell ophelia o help him you sweet heavens hamlet if thou dost marry i ll give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou

fashion and the mold of form th observed of all observers quite quite down and i of ladies most deject and wretched that sucked the honey of his musicked vows now see that noble and most sovereign reason like sweet bells jangled out of time and harsh that unmatched form and stature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy o woe is me t have seen what i have seen see what i see king advancing with polonius love his affections do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lacked form a little was not like madness there s something in his soul o er which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something settled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you on t polonius it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and i ll be placed so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think king it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatched go they exit scene 2 enter hamlet and three of the players hamlet speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of our players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of your passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for o erdoing termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it player i warrant your honor hamlet be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so o erdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it makes the unskillful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o erweigh a whole theater of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having th accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature s journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably player i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us sir hamlet o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that s villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you ready players exit enter polonius guildenstern and rosencrantz how now my lord will the king hear this piece of work polonius and the queen too and that presently hamlet bid

second husband kisses me in bed player king i do believe you think what now you speak but what we do determine oft we break purpose is but the slave to memory of violent birth but poor validity which now the fruit unripe sticks on the tree but fall unshaken when they mellow be most necessary tis that we forget to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt what to ourselves in passion we propose the passion ending doth the purpose lose the violence of either grief or joy their own enactures with themselves destroy where joy most revels grief doth most lament grief joys joy grieves on slender accident this world is not for aye nor tis not strange that even our loves should with our fortunes change for tis a question left us yet to prove whether love lead fortune or else fortune love the great man down you mark his favorite flies the poor advanced makes friends of enemies and hitherto doth love on fortune tend for who not needs shall never lack a friend and who in want a hollow friend doth try directly seasons him his enemy but orderly to end where i begun our wills and fates do so contrary run that our devices still are overthrown our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own

offense is rank it smells to heaven it hath the primal eldest curse upon t a brother s murder pray can i not though inclination be as sharp as will my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent and like a man to double business bound i stand in pause where i shall first begin and both neglect what if this cursed hand were thicker than itself with brother s blood is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow whereto serves mercy but to confront the visage of offense and what s in prayer but this twofold force to be forestalled ere we come to fall or pardoned being down then i ll look up my fault is past but o what form of prayer can serve my turn forgive me my foul murder that cannot be since i am still possessed of those effects for which i did the murder my crown mine own ambition and my queen may one be pardoned and retain th offense in the corrupted currents of this world offense s gilded hand may shove by justice and oft tis seen the wicked prize itself buys out the law but tis not so above there is no shuffling there the action lies in his true nature and we ourselves compelled even to the teeth and forehead of our faults to give in evidence what

friend sith you have heard and with a knowing ear that he which hath your noble father slain pursued my life laertes it well appears but tell me why you proceeded not against these feats so criminal and so capital in nature as by your safety greatness wisdom all things else you mainly were stirred up king o for two special reasons which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed but yet to me they re strong the queen his mother lives almost by his looks and for myself my virtue or my plague be it either which she is so conjunctive to my life and soul that as the star moves not but in his sphere i could not but by her the other motive why to a public count i might not go is the great love the general gender bear him who dipping all his faults in their affection work like the spring that turneth wood to stone convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows too slightly timbered for so loud a wind would have reverted to my bow again but not where i have aimed them laertes and so have i a noble father lost a sister driven into desp rate terms whose worth if praises may go back again stood challenger on mount of all the age for her perfections but my revenge will come king break not your

reads high and mighty you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom tomorrow shall i beg leave to see your kingly eyes when i shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return hamlet what should this mean are all the rest come back or is it some abuse and no such thing laertes know you the hand king tis hamlet s character naked and in a postscript here he says alone can you advise me laertes i am lost in it my lord but let him come it warms the very sickness in my heart that i shall live and tell him to his teeth thus didst thou king if it be so laertes as how should it be so how otherwise will you be ruled by me laertes ay my lord so you will not o errule me to a peace king to thine own peace if he be now returned as checking at his voyage and that he means no more to undertake it i will work him to an exploit now ripe in my device under the which he shall not choose but fall and for his death no wind of blame shall breathe but even his mother shall uncharge the practice and call it accident laertes my lord i will be ruled the rather if you could devise it so that i might be the organ king it falls right you have been talked of since your travel much and that in hamlet s hearing for a quality wherein they say you shine your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one and that in my regard of the unworthiest siege laertes what part is that my lord king a very ribbon in the cap of youth yet needful too for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears than settled age his sables and his weeds importing health and graveness two months since here was a gentleman of normandy i have seen myself and served against the french and they can well on horseback but this gallant had witchcraft in t he grew unto his seat and to such wondrous doing brought his horse as had he been encorpsed and demi natured with the brave beast so far he topped my thought that i in forgery of shapes and tricks come short of what he did laertes a norman was t king a norman laertes upon my life lamord king the very same laertes i know him well he is the brooch indeed and gem of all the nation king he made confession of you and gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your defense and for your rapier most especial that he cried out twould be a sight indeed if one could match you the scrimers of their nation he swore had neither motion guard nor eye if you opposed them sir this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming o er to play with you now out of this laertes what out of this my lord king laertes was your father dear to you or are you like the painting of a sorrow a face without a heart laertes why ask you this king not that i think you did not love your father but that i know love is begun by time and that i see in passages of proof time qualifies the spark and fire of it there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it and nothing is at a like goodness still for goodness growing to a pleurisy dies in his own too much that we would do we should do when we would for this would changes and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues are hands are accidents and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing but to the quick of th ulcer hamlet comes back what would you undertake to show yourself indeed your father s son more than in words laertes to cut his throat i th church king no place indeed should murder sanctuarize revenge should have no bounds but good laertes will you do this keep close within your chamber hamlet returned shall know you are come home we ll put on those shall praise your excellence and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gave you bring you in fine together and wager on your heads he being remiss most generous and free from all contriving will not peruse the foils so that with ease or with a little shuffling you may choose a sword unbated and in a pass of practice requite him for your father laertes i will do t and for that purpose i ll anoint my sword i bought an unction of a mountebank so mortal that but dip a knife in it where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare collected from all simples that have virtue under the moon can save the thing from death that is but scratched withal i ll touch my point with this contagion that if i gall him slightly it may be death king let s further think of this weigh what convenience both of time and means may fit us to our shape if this should fail and that our drift look through our bad performance twere better not assayed therefore this project should have a back or second that might hold if this did blast in proof soft let me see we ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings i ha t when in your motion you are hot and dry as make your bouts more violent to that end and that he calls for drink i ll

dangerous which let thy wisdom fear hold off thy hand king pluck them asunder queen hamlet hamlet all gentlemen horatio good my lord be quiet hamlet and laertes are separated hamlet why i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag queen o my son what theme hamlet i loved ophelia forty thousand brothers could not with all their quantity of love make up my sum what wilt

as patient as the female dove when that her golden couplets are disclosed his silence will sit drooping hamlet hear you sir what is the reason that you use me thus i loved you ever but it is no matter let hercules himself do what he may the cat will mew and dog will have his day hamlet exits king i pray thee good horatio wait upon him horatio exits to laertes strengthen your patience in our last night s speech we ll put the matter to the present push good gertrude set some watch over your son this grave shall have a living monument an hour of quiet thereby shall we see till then in patience our proceeding be they exit scene 2 enter hamlet and horatio hamlet so much for this sir now shall you see the other you do remember all the circumstance horatio remember it my lord hamlet sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep methought i lay worse than the mutines in the bilboes rashly and praised be rashness for it let us know our indiscretion sometime serves us well when our deep plots do pall and that should learn us there s a divinity that shapes our ends rough hew them how we will horatio that is most certain hamlet up from my cabin my sea gown scarfed about me in the dark groped i to find out them had my desire fingered their packet and in fine withdrew to mine own room again making so bold my fears forgetting manners to unfold their grand commission where i found horatio a royal knavery an exact command larded with many several sorts of reasons importing denmark s health and england s too with ho such bugs and goblins in my life that on the supervise no leisure bated no not to stay the grinding of the ax my head should be struck off horatio is t possible hamlet here s the commission read it at more leisure handing him a paper but wilt thou hear now how i did proceed horatio i beseech you hamlet being thus benetted round with villainies or i could make a prologue to my brains they had begun the play i sat me down devised a new commission wrote it fair i once did hold it as our statists do a baseness to write fair and labored much how to forget that learning but sir now it did me yeoman s service wilt thou know th effect of what i wrote horatio ay good my lord hamlet an earnest conjuration from the king as england was his faithful tributary as love between them like the palm might flourish as peace should still her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma tween their amities and many suchlike ases of great charge that on the view and knowing of these contents without debatement further more or less he should those bearers put to sudden death not shriving time allowed horatio how was this sealed hamlet why even in that was heaven ordinant i had my father s signet in my purse which was the model of that danish seal folded the writ up in the form of th other subscribed it gave t th impression placed it safely the changeling never known now the next day was our sea fight and what to this was sequent thou knowest already horatio so guildenstern and rosencrantz go to t hamlet why man they did make love to this employment they are not near my conscience their defeat does by their own insinuation grow tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensed points of mighty opposites horatio why what a king is this hamlet does it not think thee stand me now upon he that hath killed my king and whored my mother popped in between th election and my hopes thrown out his angle for my proper life and with such cozenage is t not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm and is t not to be damned to let this canker of our nature come in further evil horatio it must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there hamlet it will be short the interim s mine and a man s life s no more than to say one but i am very sorry good horatio that to laertes i forgot myself for by the image of my cause i see the portraiture of his i ll court his favors but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a tow ring passion horatio peace who comes here enter osric a courtier osric your lordship is right welcome back to denmark hamlet i humbly thank you sir aside to horatio dost know this waterfly horatio aside to hamlet no my good lord hamlet aside to horatio thy state is the more gracious for tis a vice to know him he hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the king s mess tis a chough but as i say spacious in the possession of dirt osric sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure i should impart a thing to you from his majesty hamlet i will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit put your bonnet to his right use tis for the head osric i thank your lordship it is very hot hamlet no believe me tis very cold the wind is northerly osric it is indifferent cold my lord indeed hamlet but yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion osric exceedingly my lord it is very sultry as twere i cannot tell how my lord his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head sir this is the matter hamlet i beseech you remember he motions to osric to put on his hat osric nay good my lord for my ease in good faith sir here is newly come to court laertes believe me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent differences of very soft society and great showing indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see hamlet sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though i know to divide him inventorially would dozy th arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more osric your lordship speaks most infallibly of him hamlet the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath osric sir horatio is t not possible to understand in another tongue you will to t sir really hamlet to osric what imports the nomination of this gentleman osric of laertes horatio his purse is empty already all s golden words are spent hamlet of him sir osric i know you are not ignorant hamlet i would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me well sir osric you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is hamlet i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself osric i mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him by them in his meed he s unfellowed hamlet what s his weapon osric rapier and dagger hamlet that s two of his weapons but well osric the king sir hath wagered with him six barbary horses against the which he has impawned as i take it six french rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and so three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of very liberal conceit hamlet what call you the carriages horatio i knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done osric the carriages sir are the hangers hamlet the phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides i would it might be hangers till then but on six barbary horses against six french swords their assigns and three liberal conceited carriages that s the french bet against the danish why is this all impawned as you call it osric the king sir hath laid sir that in a dozen passes between yourself and him he shall not exceed you three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer hamlet how if i answer no osric i mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial hamlet sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty it is the breathing time of day with me let the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose i will win for him an i can if not i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits osric shall i deliver you e en so hamlet to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will osric i commend my duty to your lordship hamlet yours osric exits he does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else for s turn horatio this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head hamlet he did comply sir with his dug before he sucked it thus has he and many more of the same breed that i know the drossy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and out of an habit of encounter a kind of yeasty collection which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out enter a lord lord my lord his majesty commended him to you by young osric who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with laertes or that you will take longer time hamlet i am constant to my purposes they follow the king s pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided i be so able as now lord the king and queen and all are coming down hamlet in happy time lord the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to laertes before you fall to play hamlet she well instructs me lord exits horatio you will lose my lord hamlet i do not think so since he went into france i have been in continual practice i shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not think how ill all s here about my heart but it is no matter horatio nay good my lord hamlet it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman horatio if your mind dislike anything obey it i will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit hamlet not a whit we defy augury there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow if it be now tis not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readiness is all since no man of aught he leaves knows what is t to leave betimes let be a table prepared enter trumpets drums and officers with cushions king queen osric and all the state foils daggers flagons of wine and laertes king come hamlet come and take this hand from me he puts laertes hand into hamlet s hamlet to laertes give me your pardon sir i have done you wrong but pardon t as you are a gentleman this presence knows and you must needs have heard how i am punished with a sore distraction what i have done that might your nature honor and exception roughly awake i here proclaim was madness was t hamlet wronged laertes never hamlet if hamlet from himself be ta en away and when he s not himself does wrong laertes then hamlet does it not hamlet denies it who does it then his madness if t be so hamlet is of the faction that is wronged his madness is poor hamlet s enemy sir in this audience let my disclaiming from a purposed evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts that i have shot my arrow o er the house and hurt my brother laertes i am satisfied in nature whose motive in this case should stir me most to my revenge but in my terms of honor i stand aloof and will no reconcilement till by some elder masters of known honor i have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungored but till that time i do receive your offered love like love and will not wrong it hamlet i embrace it freely and will this brothers wager frankly play give us the foils come on laertes come one for me hamlet i ll be your foil laertes in mine ignorance your skill shall like a star i th darkest night stick fiery off indeed laertes you mock me sir hamlet no by this hand king give them the foils young osric cousin hamlet you know the wager hamlet very well my lord your grace has laid the odds o th weaker side king i do not fear it i have seen you both but since he is better we have therefore odds laertes this is too heavy let me see another hamlet this likes me well these foils have all a length osric ay my good lord prepare to play king set me the stoups of wine upon that table if hamlet give the first or second hit or quit in answer of the third exchange let all the battlements their ordnance fire the king shall drink to hamlet s better breath and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that which four successive kings in denmark s crown have worn give me the cups and let the kettle to the trumpet speak the trumpet to the cannoneer without the cannons to the heavens the heaven to earth now the king drinks to hamlet come begin and you the judges bear a wary eye trumpets the while hamlet come on sir laertes come my lord they play hamlet one laertes no hamlet judgment osric a hit a very palpable hit laertes well again king stay give me drink hamlet this pearl is thine here s to thy health he drinks and then drops the pearl in the cup drum trumpets and shot give him the cup hamlet i ll play this bout first set it by awhile come they play another hit what say you laertes a touch a touch i do confess t king our son shall win queen he s fat and scant of breath here hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows the queen carouses to thy fortune hamlet she lifts the cup hamlet good madam king gertrude do not drink queen i will my lord i pray you pardon me she drinks king aside it is the poisoned cup it is too late hamlet i dare not drink yet madam by and by queen come let me wipe thy face laertes to claudius my lord i ll hit him now king i do not think t laertes aside and yet it is almost against my conscience hamlet come for the third laertes you do but dally i pray you pass with your best violence i am afeard you make a wanton of me laertes say you so come on play osric nothing neither way laertes have at you now laertes wounds hamlet then in scuffling they change rapiers and hamlet wounds laertes king part them they are incensed hamlet nay come again the queen falls osric look to the queen there ho horatio they bleed on both sides how is it my lord osric how is t laertes laertes why as a woodcock to mine own springe osric he falls i am justly killed with mine own treachery hamlet how does the queen king she swoons to see them bleed queen no no the drink the drink o my dear hamlet the drink the drink i am poisoned she dies hamlet o villainy ho let the door be locked osric exits treachery seek it out laertes it is here hamlet hamlet thou art slain no med cine in the world can do thee good in thee there is not half an hour s life the treacherous instrument is in thy hand unbated and envenomed the foul practice hath turned itself on me lo here i lie never to rise again thy mother s poisoned i can no more the king the king s to blame hamlet the point envenomed too then venom to thy work hurts the king all treason treason king o yet defend me friends i am but hurt hamlet here thou incestuous murd rous damned dane drink off this potion is thy union here forcing him to drink the poison follow my mother king dies laertes he is justly served it is a poison tempered by himself exchange forgiveness with me noble hamlet mine and my father s death come not upon thee nor thine on me dies hamlet heaven make thee free of it i follow thee i am dead horatio wretched queen adieu you that look pale and tremble at this chance that are but mutes or audience to this act had i but time as this fell sergeant death is strict in his arrest o i could tell you but let it be horatio i am dead thou livest report me and my cause aright to the unsatisfied horatio never believe it i am more an antique roman than a dane here s yet some liquor left he picks up the cup hamlet as thou rt a man give me the cup let go by heaven i ll ha t o god horatio what a wounded name things standing thus unknown shall i leave behind me if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart absent thee from felicity awhile and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain to tell my story a march afar off and shot within what warlike noise is this enter osric osric young fortinbras with conquest come from poland to th ambassadors of england gives this warlike volley hamlet o i die horatio the potent poison quite o ercrows my spirit i cannot live to hear the news from england but i do prophesy th election lights on fortinbras he has my dying voice so tell him with th occurrents more and less which have solicited the rest is silence o o o o dies horatio now cracks a noble heart good night sweet prince and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest march within why does the drum come hither enter fortinbras with the english ambassadors with drum colors and attendants fortinbras where is this sight horatio what is it you would see if aught of woe or wonder cease your search fortinbras this quarry cries on havoc o proud death what feast is toward in thine eternal cell that thou so many princes at a shot so bloodily hast struck ambassador the sight is dismal and our affairs from england come too late the ears are senseless that should give us hearing to tell him his commandment is fulfilled that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead where should we have our thanks horatio not from his mouth had it th ability of life to thank you he never gave commandment for their death but since so jump upon this bloody question you from the polack wars and you from england are here arrived give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view and let me speak to th yet unknowing world how these things came about so shall you hear of carnal bloody and unnatural acts of accidental judgments casual slaughters of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause and in this upshot purposes mistook fall n on th inventors heads all this can i truly deliver fortinbras let us haste to hear it and call the noblest to the audience for me with sorrow i embrace my fortune i have some rights of memory in this kingdom which now to claim my vantage doth invite me horatio of that i shall have also cause to speak and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more but let this same be presently performed even while men s minds are wild lest more mischance on plots and errors happen fortinbras let four captains bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage for he was likely had he been put on to have proved most royal and for his passage the soldier s music and the rite of war speak loudly for him take up the bodies such a sight as this becomes the field but here shows much amiss go bid the soldiers shoot they exit marching after the which a peal of ordnance are shot off \n"
